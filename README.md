# Spotify-keybinds
Pause or skip Spotify without having to alt-tab into it.

## requirements:
* Python 3.7+
* python module 'keyboard'; pip install keyboard

Once you run the spot.py file it should open the settings prompt. You will be asked to make a [Spotify application](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications) and provide the details to it. After that you'll need to authorize it - a browser tab should open. Once it redirects to localhost, feel free to close it.

To enter keybinds press the key(s) and then press escape.
